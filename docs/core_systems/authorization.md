## Configuration

The system configuration properties can be found in the `application.properties` file located at `/src/main/resources` folder.

**_Note:_** During the build process this file is going to be built into the executable JAR, but also going to be copied next to the JAR file. Any modification in the configuration file located next to the executable JAR file will override the built in configuration property value.

### General parameters

Password to the database.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.datasource.driver-class-name**

The driver provides the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.jpa.show-sql**

Set to `true` in order to log out the SQL queries.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format sql**

}
```

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **enable.management.filter**

Maximum token usage default in case of usage-limited simple tokens.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **unbounded.token.generation.whitelist**

Comma-separated list that contains the name of systems that can generate tokens for other systems by bypassing their authorization checks.

### Logging configuration

The logging configuration properties can be found in the `log4j2.xml` file located at `src/main/resources`

**_Note:_** During the build process this file is going to be built into the executable JAR, but it is also possible to
override it by an external file. For that use the following command when starting the system:

     -Dlog4j.configurationFile=path-to-external-file
```

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **JDBC_LEVEL**
