## Configuration

The system configuration properties can be found in the `application.properties` file located at `/src/main/resources` folder.

**_Note:_** During the build process this file is going to be built into the executable JAR, but also going to be copied next to the JAR file. Any modification in the configuration file located next to the executable JAR file will override the built in configuration property value.

### General parameters

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **server.address**

IP address of the server.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **server.port**

Port number of the server

### Database parameters

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.datasource.url**

URL to the database.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.datasource.username**

Username to the database.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.datasource.password**

Password to the database.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.datasource.driver-class-name**

The driver provides the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query
and result between client and database.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.jpa.show-sql**

Set to true in order to log out the SQL queries.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format sql**

Set to true to log out SQL queries in pretty format. (Effective only when 'spring.jpa.show-sql' is 'true')

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto**

Auto initialization of database tables. Value must be always 'none'.

### Custom parameters

TODO

### Logging configuration

The logging configuration properties can be found in the `log4j2.xml` file located at `src/main/resources`
folder.

**_Note:_** During the build process this file is going to be built into the executable JAR, but it is also possible to
override it by an external file. For that use the following command when starting the system:
```
java -jar arrowhead-serviceregistry-x.x.x
     -Dlog4j.configurationFile=path-to-external-file
```

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **JDBC_LEVEL**

Set this to change the level of log messages in the database. Levels: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
ERROR, FATAL, OFF.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **CONSOLE FILE LEVEL**

Set this to change the level of log messages in consol and the log file. Levels: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG,
INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF.

:fontawesome-solid-wrench: **LOG_DIR**
