## What is it?

The **Eclipse Arrowhead Framework** is addressing IoT based automation and digitalisation. The generic concept is based on the principles of Service Oriented Architectures, and aims at enabling all of its users to work in a common and unified approach â€“ leading towards high levels of interoperability. The approach taken is that the information exchange of elements in the Internet of Things is abstracted to loosely coupled services. This is to enable IoT interoperability in-between almost any IoT elements.

The smallest unit of governance within the Arrowhead Framework is related to a **Local Cloud**, which in general is a closed, local industrial network. Each Local Cloud is recommended to host the core systems within its network: creating the minimal supported functionality needed to enable collaboration and information exchange between the various systems within the local cloud. The four recommended core system for each Local Cloud are the **Service Registry**, the **Service Orchestration**, the **Service Authorization** and the **Authentication**.

In addition to the recommended core systems, a number of additional, supporting core systems and services are provided to enable the design, engineering, operation and maintenance of IoT-based automation system of systems.
