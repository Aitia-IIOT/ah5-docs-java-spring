# Communication Profiles

A Communication Profile (CP) defines the rules to be followed and the properties to be applied to a given communication protocol.

This Arrowhead FW implementation is offering the following CPs to interact with services of the Core/Support systems and also to apply by the provider systems developers:

| CP | Security|
| --- | --- |
| [Generic HTTP](./generic-http-template.md) | Not secured |
| [Generic HTTPS](./generic-https-template.md) | Encrypted data transfer | 
| [Generic MQTT](./generic-mqtt-template.md) | Not secured |  
| [Generic MQTTS](./generic-mqtts-template.md) | Encrypted data transfer |
