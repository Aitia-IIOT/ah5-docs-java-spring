# authorizationToken IDD
**generic_mqtt & generic_mqtts**

## Overview

This page describes the generic_mqtt and generic_mqtts service interface of authorizationToken, which enables the verification of service consumption permissions on the provider system side, and the application of session-based service consumption control between the consumer and provider systems. An example of this interaction is when a consumer system with proper permissions obtains an expiring token of the appropriate type, which is then attached to its service consumption attempt. The provider system verifies the received token and performs the service operation only if the token has not expired and is valid for the actual service operation. Additionally, provider systems can choose to have the tokens generated for their services encrypted. Tokens for Event notification are also handled by this service in an event publisher/subscriber scenario. To enable other systems to use, to consume it, this service needs to be offered through the ServiceRegistry.

The interfaces are implemented using protocol, encoding as stated in the following tables:

### generate

The service operation **request** requires an [MQTTRequestTemplate](../data-models/mqtt-request-template.md) JSON encoded message in which the authentication is a proper [identity info](../../api/authentication_policy.md/#mqtt) and the payload is an [AuthorizationTokenGenerationRequest](../data-models/authorization-token-generation-request.md).

```
Topic: arrowhead/consumer-authorization/authorization-token/generate

{
   "traceId": "<trace-id>",
   "authentication": "<identity-info>",
   "responseTopic": "<response-topic>",
   "qosRequirement": <0|1|2>,
   "payload": {
      "tokenVariant": "USAGE_LIMITED_TOKEN_AUTH",
      "provider": "TemperatureProvider2",
      "targetType": "SERVICE_DEF",
      "target": "kelvinInfo",
      "scope": "query-temperature"
   }
}
```

The service operation **responds** with an [MQTTResponseTemplate](../data-models/mqtt-response-template.md) JSON encoded message in which the status code is `201` if called successfully and token has been generated. The response template payload is an [AuthorizationTokenDescriptor](../data-models/authorization-token-descriptor.md).

```
{
   "status": 201,
   "traceId": "<trace-id>",
   "receiver": "TemperatureConsumer",
   "payload" :{
      "tokenType": "USAGE_LIMITED_TOKEN",
      "targetType": "SERVICE_DEF",
      "token": "dsalefb521vdjkdsae633",
      "usageLimit": 10
   }
}
```

The **error codes** are `400` if the request is malformed, `401` if the requester authentication was unsuccessful, `403` if the authenticated requester has no permission and `500` Error if an unexpected error happens. In these cases the response template payload is an [ErrorResponse](../data-models/error-response.md) JSON.

```
{
   "status": 400,
   "traceId": "<trace-id>",
   "receiver": "TemperatureConsumer",
   "payload": {
     "errorMessage": "Target is missing",
     "errorCode": 400,
