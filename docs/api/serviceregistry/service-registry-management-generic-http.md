# service-registry-management GENERIC-HTTP

## Overview
This page describes the service-registry-management service, which enables systems (with operator role or proper permissions) to handle (register, update, revoke, lookup) [devices](#device-query), [systems](#system-query), [service instances](#service-query), [service definitions](#service-definition-query) and [interface template](#interface-template-query) in bulk. An example of this interaction is that an operator uses the Management Tool to register interface templates, systems, and service instances manually. The interfaces are implemented using protocol, encoding as stated in the following tables:

## Interface Description

### device-query

The service operation **request** requires an authorization bearer header and a [DeviceQueryRequest](../data-models/device-query-request.md) JSON encoded body.

```
POST /serviceregistry/mgmt/devices/query HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <authorization-info>

{
  "pagination": {
    "page": 0,
    "size": 10,
    "direction": "ASC",
    "sortField": "name"
  },
  "deviceNames": [
  ],
  "addresses": [
  ],
  "addressType": "",
  "metadataRequirementList": [
    {
      "volume.value": {"op": "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS_TO", "value": 90},
      "volume.unit": {"op": "EQUALS", "value": "dB"}
    }
  ]
}
```

The service operation **responds** with the status code `200` if called successfully. The response also contains a
[DeviceListResponse](../data-models/device-list-response.md) JSON encoded body.

```
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "name": "alarm1",
      "metadata": {
        "volume": {
          "value": 100,
          "unit": "dB"
        }
      },
      "addresses": [
        {
          "type": "MAC",
          "address": "3a:f7:9c:12:8e:b5"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-03-10T09:09:58Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-03-10T09:09:58Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "alarm2",
      "metadata": {
        "volume": {
          "value": 110,
          "unit": "dB"
        }
      },
      "addresses": [
        {
          "type": "MAC",
          "address": "3a:f7:9c:12:8e:bb"

      "updatedAt": "2025-03-10T09:09:58Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

The **error codes** are `400` if the request is malformed, `401` if the requester authentication was unsuccessful,
`403` if the authenticated requester has no permission and
`500` if an unexpected error happens. The error response also contains an
[ErrorResponse](../data-models/error-response.md) JSON encoded body.

```
{
  "errorMessage": "Sort field is invalid. Only the following are allowed: [id, name, createdAt]",
  "errorCode": 400,
  "exceptionType": "INVALID_PARAMETER",
  "origin": "POST /serviceregistry/mgmt/devices/query"
}
```

### device-create
