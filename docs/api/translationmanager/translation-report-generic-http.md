## Interface Description

### report

The service operation **request** requires an [identity related header or certificate](../authentication_policy.md/#http) and an [TranslationReportRequest](../data-models/translation-report-request.md)
JSON encoded body.


```
POST /translation/event/report HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <authorization-info>

{
  "bridgeId": "2240efa3-fde4-4f81-a625-04f1234acee7",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T10:30:00Z",
  "state": "USED"
}
```

The service operation **responds** with the status code `200` if called successfully. The success response does not contain any response body.

The **error codes** are `400` if the request is malformed, `401` if the requester authentication was unsuccessful,
`403` if the authenticated requester has no permission and `500` if an unexpected error happens. The error response also contains an
[ErrorResponse](../data-models/error-response.md) JSON encoded body.

```
{
  "errorMessage": "Requester has no permission to report about the specified translation bridge",
  "errorCode": 403,
  "exceptionType": "FORBIDDEN",
  "origin": "DELETE  /translation/event/report"
}
```
