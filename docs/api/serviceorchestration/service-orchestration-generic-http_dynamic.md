# serviceOrchestration IDD (dynamic strategy)
**generic_http & generic_https**

## Overview

This page describes the [generic_http](../communication-profiles/generic-http-template.md) and [generic_https](../communication-profiles/generic-https-template.md) service interface of serviceOrchestration, which provides runtime (late) binding between application systems. 

Hereby the **Interface Design Description** (IDD) is provided to the [serviceOrchestration â€“ Service Description](../../assets/sd/5_0_0/service-orchestration_sd.pdf). For further details about how this service is meant to be used, please consult that document.

## Interface Description

### pull

The service operation **request** requires an [identity related header or certificate](../authentication_policy.md/#http) and a [ServiceOrchestrationRequest](../data-models/service-orchestration-request.md) JSON encoded body.

```
POST /serviceorchestration/orchestration/pull HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <identity-info>

{
   "serviceRequirement": {
      "serviceDefinition": "kelvinInfo",
      "operations": [
         "query-temperature"
      ],
      "versions": [],
      "alivesAt": "2025-10-05T11:35:14Z",
      "metadataRequirements": [],
      "interfaceTemplateNames": [

         "IPV4"
      ],
      "interfacePropertyRequirements": [],

```

The service operation **responds** with the status code `200` if called successfully and with a [ServiceOrchestrationResponse](../data-models/service-orchestration-response.md) JSON encoded body.

### unsubscribe

The service operation **request** requires an [identity related header or certificate](../authentication_policy.md/#http) and a subscription [UUID](../primitives.md#uuid) as path parameter.
