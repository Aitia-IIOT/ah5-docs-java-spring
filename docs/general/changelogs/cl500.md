# CL-5.0.0

**Planned release date:** 31/07/2025

## :material-note-edit-outline: general

**This is it the inital release of the 5th generation, which is not backward compatible with the 4th generation! Main conceptual chages:**

- The reference implementation of 4th generation relied on an interconnected data storage between the core and supporting systems. This setup had to be changed due to the requirement for “independent working modes,” therefore in the 5th generation each core and support system have its own database.
- The above described fundamental change also means that database record identifiers are no longer used to identify entities (system instances, service definitions, etc.). Entities have unique identifiers (names) at the cloud level.
- The previous authentication mechanism relied on the X.509 certificates. In addition, the integration of various authentication mechanisms is supported by the introduction of the Authentication Core System.

## :fontawesome-brands-java: arrowhead-serviceregistry

**Initial 5th generation release. Main changes compared to 4th generation:**

- The system has its own database.
- Services are represented according to the service-operation design pattern.
- In addition to service and system data, device data registration is also possible.
- The interface representation of a service operation is much flexible and more expressive to ensure that translation support services could rely on the interface data stored by Service Registry Core System.
- MQTT communication protocol support.
