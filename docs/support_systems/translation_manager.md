# Translation Manager

This Support system can discover whether a consumer can consume possible providers' service operation even if there is no common interface between them or are using different data models. If an appropriate provider is selected, the Support System can build a translation bridge between the consumer and the provider using an independent interface translator and optionally one or two data model translators. The Translation Manager is also storing information about the translation bridges.

## Services

### translationBridge

The purpose of translationBridge is to find providers whose service operation is accessible by the requester via a translation bridge using the currently available translators and to build/abort such bridges. This service is offered for Application systems (consumers).

**discovery**

This service operation checks a list of possible providers for a service operation and returns only those that can be consumed by the requester via a translation bridge using the currently available translators.

**negotiation**

This service operation allows consumers to create a translation bridge to one selected provider's one particular service operation. It is possible to do discovery during the negotiation if no prior discovery is happened.

**abort**

This service operation aborts an existing bridge created by the requester. After abortion the targeted service operation will not be available via the bridge.
