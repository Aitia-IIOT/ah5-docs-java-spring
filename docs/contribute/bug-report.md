# Bug Report

## Suspect a Vulnerability?

If you think you have found a vulnerability, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or change requests.**

Instead, report it using one of the following ways:

* Contact the [Eclipse Foundation Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) via email
* Create a [confidential issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability) in the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Tracker

You can find more information about reporting and disclosure at the [Eclipse Foundation Security page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).
